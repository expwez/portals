# Portals Module

Portals is a room where shaman helps mice to get cheese using only arrows and portals. The difficulty for maps varies from 1 to 5 difficulty (1 = easy, 5 = hard). Donâ€™t think this is going to be easy: if you want to get experience to level up, you have to help mice which is hard. Test your abilities and find out how smart you are to complete maps!

  - Level-up system
  - Nothing is allowed to be spawned except for portals and arrows
  - 5 difficulty levels
  - The higher the difficulty the harder you think

# Build

I have created a generator for interaction of lua and xml files which is easy to use. To assemble the executive transformice file you need to execute:

```sh
$ python generate.py
```
Also if you want the file to be dynamically generated  while editing any of used files add an argument: 
```sh
$ python generate.py --watch
```
